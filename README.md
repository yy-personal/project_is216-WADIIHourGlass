## :page_facing_up: Project Overview :page_facing_up: ##
#### Describe your project. What is it called? What does it do? Why did you make this web application? Who will benefit from using your web application? Describe your users - who are they? (anyone? or specific target age group or gender? region? country?)
According to Kisi‚Äôs Work Life Balance Index, Singapore is the second most overworked city in the world. We hope to address this issue with a calendar/scheduling app that helps nudge the user towards optimal time management and sufficient relaxation. In this project, our team aims to build a web-based calendar portal that consolidates all of the user‚Äôs daily itinerary. This webpage allows the user to easily schedule a meetup with another person by simply sharing a link. In addition, the webpage would assess the user‚Äôs work-life balance based on his/her schedule and recommend him/her appropriate activities to wind down. We aim to achieve this in a visually attractive and interactive manner.
